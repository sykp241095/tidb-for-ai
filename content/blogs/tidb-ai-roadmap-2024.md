# TiDB AI Roadmap 2024: What's Coming Next

As we move into 2024, the AI landscape continues to evolve rapidly, and TiDB is committed to staying at the forefront of AI-native database technology. Today, we're excited to share our roadmap for the coming year, packed with features that will make TiDB the most powerful platform for AI applications.

## Q1 2024: Enhanced Vector Capabilities

### Multi-Modal Vector Support

We're expanding beyond text embeddings to support multiple data types in a single vector space:

```sql
-- Coming soon: Multi-modal vector columns
CREATE TABLE multimedia_content (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    text_content TEXT,
    image_path VARCHAR(255),
    -- Unified vector for text + image
    multimodal_embedding VECTOR(1024) COMMENT 'hnsw(distance=cosine)',
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

**Key Features:**
- **CLIP-style embeddings** for text and image combination
- **Audio vector support** for voice and music applications
- **Cross-modal search** capabilities
- **Unified similarity scoring** across data types

### Auto-Embedding Generation

Eliminate the need for manual embedding generation with built-in AI models:

```sql
-- Automatic embedding generation
CREATE TABLE smart_documents (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT,
    -- Auto-generated embedding using built-in models
    content_vector VECTOR(768)
        GENERATED ALWAYS AS (AI_EMBED(content, 'sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2'))
        STORED COMMENT 'hnsw(distance=cosine)'
);
```

## Q2 2024: Intelligent Query Optimization

### AI-Powered Query Planning

TiDB will automatically optimize vector queries using machine learning:

- **Adaptive indexing** based on query patterns
- **Dynamic parameter tuning** for HNSW and IVF indexes
- **Cost-based optimization** for hybrid queries
- **Automatic materialized views** for common vector operations

### Smart Data Partitioning

```sql
-- AI-suggested partitioning for optimal performance
CREATE TABLE large_embeddings (
    id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY,
    category VARCHAR(50),
    embedding VECTOR(1536)
) PARTITION BY AI_SUGGEST(embedding, category);
```

## Q3 2024: Real-Time AI Features

### Streaming Vector Updates

Process and update embeddings in real-time as data changes:

```python
# Real-time embedding updates
@tidb.on_data_change('documents', 'content')
def update_embedding(old_content, new_content, doc_id):
    if content_changed_significantly(old_content, new_content):
        new_embedding = generate_embedding(new_content)
        tidb.update_vector('documents', doc_id, new_embedding)
```

### Live Learning Capabilities

TiDB will learn from query patterns to improve search relevance:

- **Click-through learning** for search ranking
- **User feedback integration** for personalization
- **A/B testing framework** for search algorithms
- **Automatic model retraining** based on usage patterns

## Q4 2024: Advanced AI Integrations

### Native LLM Integration

Direct integration with popular LLM providers:

```sql
-- Native LLM calls within SQL
SELECT
    id,
    title,
    AI_COMPLETE(
        'gpt-4',
        CONCAT('Summarize this article: ', content),
        '{"max_tokens": 150}'
    ) as summary
FROM articles
WHERE category = 'technology';
```

### Federated AI Search

Search across multiple TiDB clusters and external data sources:

```python
# Federated search across multiple sources
results = tidb.federated_search(
    query="machine learning best practices",
    sources=[
        "tidb://cluster1/knowledge_base",
        "tidb://cluster2/documentation",
        "elasticsearch://logs.company.com",
        "pinecone://external-vectors"
    ]
)
```

## Developer Experience Improvements

### Enhanced Python SDK

```python
# Simplified vector operations
from tidb_ai import VectorStore, EmbeddingModel

# One-line setup for common use cases
store = VectorStore.for_rag(
    connection=tidb_connection,
    embedding_model="openai/text-embedding-3-small",
    chunk_size=512
)

# Simple document ingestion
store.add_documents([
    {"title": "Guide 1", "content": "..."},
    {"title": "Guide 2", "content": "..."}
])

# Natural language querying
results = store.search("How do I optimize vector search?")
```

### Visual Query Builder

A web-based interface for building complex vector queries without writing SQL:

- **Drag-and-drop query construction**
- **Visual similarity threshold adjustment**
- **Real-time query performance visualization**
- **One-click deployment to production**

## Performance and Scalability

### Distributed Vector Processing

- **Automatic sharding** of vector indexes across nodes
- **Parallel vector similarity computation**
- **Cross-region vector replication** with consistency guarantees
- **Elastic scaling** based on query load

### Memory Optimization

- **Compressed vector storage** with minimal accuracy loss
- **Intelligent caching** of frequently accessed vectors
- **Memory-mapped vector indexes** for large datasets
- **GPU acceleration** for vector computations

## Enterprise Features

### Advanced Security
